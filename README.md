# CRM-System



Hi guys, I’m Mizerth and I’m a student of software engineering and right now I’m doing a project. I want to remember that this is not the final model. I'm sharing it because I need help, I can't solve some problems.
The name of the project is Customer Relationship system.
CRM SYSTEM OF ONE I HAVE TO DEVELOP FROM THE EU.
the system of focus on the creation of the client's profile applying some design patterns to facilitate the creation of it.
 The main functions of the system are to insert the customer's information and this same information must be saved either in the database or in the datafile or both at the same time, this works perfectly.
Second function to delete this information in the base data part is already done.
I would like you to help me solve the function to update and enter information in JTABLE.
The program must have a database, GUI interface.
